# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-Bot

It is a simple game built using Python and integrating a simple Prediction Algorithm of AI.


# Rules

First of all you need to choose the mode of the game :-
[0]. Player vs. Computer
[1]. Player vs. Player
[2]. Computer vs. Computer

Then you need to enter the Name of the PLAYER in case if you choose [1] or [2].

The program will then ask you to choose either X or O.

After that there will be a random decision of who gets to play first.

The Board will look like this :-

| 7 | 8 | 9 |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 1 | 2 | 3 |

You just need to input the position(1-9) and your symbol, i.e., X or O will appear in that position in the result.
